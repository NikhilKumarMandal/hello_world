# Quantum Squares Game

Welcome to **Quantum Squares Game**, a dynamic and strategic two-player game where players take turns adding particles to squares on a grid. When a square reaches critical mass, it "collapses," spreading its particles to neighboring squares. Players aim to dominate the board by owning more squares and achieving the winning score.

## Game Rules

- Players take turns adding particles to squares on the grid.
- Each square has a limit of 4 particles. When a square reaches the limit, it "collapses," spreading particles to adjacent squares.
- A square can only be occupied by one player. If it collapses, the owner of the adjacent squares can change.
- The player to reach the winning score first wins the game.

## How to Play

1. Start the game by clicking on any square. The current player‚Äôs particles will be added to the square.
2. Continue adding particles, but once a square reaches 4 particles, it will collapse, distributing particles to adjacent squares.
3. Win the game by achieving the required score (default: 10 points).
